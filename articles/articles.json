		"content": "This app demonstrates a sensor information infrastructure for the Parkville campus of the University of Melbourne. Buildings of the campus are connected to sensory devices and the sensor observation are made available in real-time. The project publishes the sensor data in open standards so other application domains can make use of the data.",

		"content": "This app demonstrates how land development proposal assessments can be improved through the use of 3D open models such as IFC and CityGML.\nSpatial representation of land development proposals is often submitted in 2D paper/image/CAD formats. The 2D design of even complex high-rise land developments is a norm. Moreover, land development assessments are applied in isolation since the responsible agencies usually do not have the infrastructure that enables sharing spatial data and automating the assessment process.",

Together with major urban renewal precincts, areas around traffic corridors and activity centres are being rezoned and redeveloped to meet Melbourne's growing population needs. Such changes are increasing the importance of effective urban planning design to achieve development outcomes that meet community expectations. Complex planning controls need to be communicated in an easily accessible and visual format.",
